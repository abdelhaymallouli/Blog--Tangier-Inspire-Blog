Create a modern, vibrant, and culturally immersive web design mockup for the 'Tangier Inspire Blog' – a collaborative digital platform promoting Tangier, Morocco’s cultural and digital initiatives. The design must be built using HTML and Tailwind CSS, fully responsive, and visually inspired by Tangier’s iconic aesthetic: Mediterranean blues, whitewashed Kasbah architecture, intricate zellige tile patterns, warm terracotta tones, artisanal textures, and the energy of the medina.
Core Pages to Design (in one cohesive style):

1. Homepage – Hero section with a stunning full-width background photo of Tangier’s coastline at golden hour (Grand Socco or Kasbah view). Overlay bold headline: 'Discover. Create. Inspire Tangier.' Below: a dynamic grid of latest articles, events, and contributor highlights (cards with images, titles, categories like Art, Tech, Events). Include a floating 'Share Your Story' CTA button.

2. Article Feed / Explore Page – Masonry or responsive grid layout of user-submitted stories with photos. Each card shows: image, title, author avatar, category badge (e.g., 'Digital', 'Art', 'Event'), like/comment count. Subtle zellige border accents on hover.

3. Submit Article Page – Clean form with rich text editor (simulated), image upload zone (drag & drop), category selector (Art, Culture, Innovation, Events), and preview. Use soft blues and warm accents.

4. Page of Admin with all the changes of Article and manage Authors.

Design Style & Tangier Cultural Elements:

* Color Palette: Deep Mediterranean blue (#0A3D62), sunset orange (#F4A261), sand beige (#E9C46A), white (#FFFFFF), terracotta (#C45A4D), mint accent (#A8D5BA)

* Typography: Use Google Fonts – Playfair Display (headings, elegant & artistic), Inter or Manrope (body, clean & modern)

* Visual Motifs: Subtle zellige geometric patterns as section dividers or background textures, hand-drawn wave lines (inspired by the Strait of Gibraltar), Moroccan arch shapes in cards/buttons.

* Imagery: Authentic photos of Tangier – Café Hafa, medina alleys, local artists, digital coworking spaces, festivals. Avoid tourist clichés; focus on real local creators.

* UI Components: Tailwind-styled cards with shadow, rounded corners, hover lift; custom category badges with icons; like/comment buttons with micro-interactions.

Tailwind CSS Requirements:

* Use utility classes only (no custom CSS unless necessary)

* Fully responsive (mobile-first: sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints)

* Dark mode toggle optional (with Moroccan night-inspired palette)

* Accessible contrast, semantic HTML

Output Format:
Generate complete, production-ready HTML files (index.html, explore.html, submit.html) with embedded Tailwind CSS via CDN. Include realistic placeholder content based on the personas (Salma, Karim, Aya, etc.). Add comments explaining layout logic.
Mood: Inspiring, community-driven, artistic, authentic, youthful, collaborative – a digital medina for Tangier’s creatives.
Final Deliverable: A visually stunning, culturally rooted, functional prototype that feels like Tangier in a browser.
